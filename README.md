## 📍 About

A registration form is a fundamental component of many websites and applications. It collects user information such as name, email, phone, and other details securely and in a structured way. Registration forms help with user signup, event registration, course enrollment and data collection. 

This project demonstrates a **clean and simple form layout** that can be extended and customized based on your requirements.
